# Budget_Calculator
A simple budget calculator with DOM manipulation and JSON

## Initial brief:
            ● Create a basic HTML file. You are required to create a budgeting website with the following specifications:

            ● Make use of session storage to store the values.

            ● Create an income object where you can put in the following information as
              attributes:
                ○ Name, as a string (E.g. Salary)
                ○ The amount, as a number (E.g. 4000)
                ○ Whether or not it is recurring, as a boolean

            ● Create 5 different objects to represent income from different places.

            ● Create an expenses object where you can put in the following information
              as attributes:
                ○ Name, as a string (E.g. Groceries)
                ○ The amount, as a number (E.g. 350)
                ○ Whether or not it is recurring, as a boolean

            ● Create 5 different objects to represent different expenses.

            ● Using a prompt box, display the income items and let the user add another
              entry.

            ● Using a prompt box, display the expenses items and let the user add
              another entry.

            ● Display the total amount of disposable income (income minus expenses)

            ● Using a prompt box, ask the user how much of their disposable income
              they would like to put into savings.

            ● Finally, create an alert to display the total amount of disposable income left.
            
            
I will be using input boxes and will display the results in the DOM instead of using prompt alerts in the browser.
This will require more coding, but will improve UX and make the project more suitable for portfolio demonstration.
